# 🌞 Solaris

**Solaris** is a todo app built as a playground for adopting new technologies and experimenting with different task management methods.

It’s mainly for my own use, but it’s open enough that others can explore, fork, or adapt it for their own workflows.

## ✨ Purpose

Solaris exists for two main reasons:

1. **Experimentation**  
   - Try out new frameworks, libraries, and architectural ideas  
   - Learn by building instead of following tutorials

2. **Exploration**  
   - Test different productivity systems (e.g. GTD, time-blocking, daily focus, etc.)
   - Iterate on how tasks are captured, prioritized, and completed

This means features may change often, break occasionally, or exist purely as experiments.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Solaris is intentionally used to adopt and learn technologies.  
The stack may change over time, and i'll probably replace parts of this stack randomly.

_Current stack:_  
- **React** - A javascript library, basically the standard in the industry at this point.
- **PayloadCMS** - The content management system used as the backend for tasks, this may seem like an odd choice, but i've found it to be a really fun and easy to use CMS and I want to build more applications with it and learn it in-depth.
- **Next.js** - The framework around React, there are many others like it but this one is most common and there's always more to learn.
- **TailwindCSS** - A CSS framework, makes writing CSS easy. Little bit controversial but its ease-of-use makes it so I can focus on features.
- **Nuqs** - A state manager using URLSearchParams
