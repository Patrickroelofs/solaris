# 🌞 Solaris

**Solaris** is a todo app built as a playground for adopting new technologies and experimenting with different task management methods.

It’s mainly for my own use, but it’s open enough that others can explore, fork, or adapt it for their own workflows.

## ✨ Purpose

Solaris exists for two main reasons:

1. **Experimentation**  
   - Try out new frameworks, libraries, and architectural ideas  
   - Learn by building instead of following tutorials

2. **Exploration**  
   - Test different productivity systems (e.g. GTD, time-blocking, daily focus, etc.)
   - Iterate on how tasks are captured, prioritized, and completed

This means features may change often, break occasionally, or exist purely as experiments.
